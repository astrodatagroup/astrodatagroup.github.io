Our group meeting is structured such that group members add slides to a shared Google slide deck with various sections and then we go through the deck as a group.
One of these sections is called "feelings" and this week most of our slides were in that section.
So, instead of our usual blog post, here's a very accurate summary of our group meeting slides [with <3 to XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2456/).
